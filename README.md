# MyInteger
Design a class named MyInteger. The class contains:
● An int data attribute named value that stores the int value represented by this object.
● A constructor that creates a MyInteger object for the specified int value.
● A getter method that returns the int value.
● A setter method that sets the int value.
● The methods iseven(self), isodd(self), and isprime(self) that return true if the value in self object is
even, odd, or prime, respectively.
● The __eq__(self, other : MyInteger) that returns true if the value in the self object is equal to the value
of the other object.
● The __str__(self) that returns the string representation of the object.
● The add(self, other : MyInteger) that adds the value of the other object to the value of the self object.
● The sub(self, other : MyInteger) that subtracts the value of the other object from the value of the self
object
● The __gt__(self, other: MyInteger) that is the implementation of > operator. If the value of the self object
is greater than thevalue of the other object, it returns true otherwise false.
● Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a client program that tests all
methods in the class.
